            <h3>Hellraiser</h3>
            <p>This was a bagatelle machine I made for our first projects, based on the horror film franchsie, <i>Hellraise</i>. Since it's a bagatelle, there are no flippers. The goal is to use the plunger to launch the pinballs into the eyes of Pinhead. The playfield was designed so that the pin's on the field would match that coming out of Pinhead. My hope was that this dark yet campy playfield design would fit the tone of the <i>Hellraiser</i> films.</p>

            <h3>Dragon Ball Z Battle Pinball</h3>
            <p>This is a head-to-head battle pinball machine based on the anime series <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>. Each side of the machine is based on one of the two main characters in the series, Goku and Vegeta. I wanted to capture the frenetic, high-energy nature of the battles in the series, so this game starts with 8 pinballs dropping on each side! Players then have to use the 3 ramps to try to knock as many balls to the other side as they can. Because of this, the game has a very interesting dynamic where the start of each match is very frantic with players just trying to hit as many balls as they can. But by the end of the match, when there are only a few balls left, we see much more calculated gameplay.</p>

            <h3>Jack Stauber Pinball</h3>
            <p>For my final project in the class, I wanted to base my machine off of a musician. I decided to do one of my favorite current artists, Jack Stauber in the visual pinball engine. I did this because I not only felt his music would work well in a Pinball machine, but that the visual style and motifs used in his music videos would make an excellent theme for a pinball board. I'm really satisfied with the end result. Rolling over all of the peppermints, starts mutliball as well as changing the song to Jack Stauber's <i>Two Time</i>. I have the song change on each ball, to make the game feel dynamic. In playing a lot of pinball for research, I found that ramps are just naturally satisfying to send the ball up and around, so I designed the playfield around have a center U ramp at the core.</p>
