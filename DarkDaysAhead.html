            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>This project was made over the course of 6 weeks for a Game Design &amp; Development II class.  The project ahad to be either a puzzle game or a horror game. Our team decided to go for a cosmic horror angle. We weren't sure how to implement that aesthetic into a gameplay system that was within our scope. We knew that horror games were made and excelled through their polish of the User experience and we were worried about being able to do so in our limited timespan. We eventually realized that the bullet hell gameplay loop naturally makes the player feel tense and with a bit of tweaking, could work incredibly well for our tone. We wanted players to feel insignifcant and incredibly small in terms of the universe. So we gave players free range to move in all directions and randomly generated terrain and obstacles. </p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Dark Days Ahead is what we described as a bullet-hell horror game drenched with existential terror. The player plays as a ball of light attempting to survive in a world of darkness. The world is procedurally generated. The player has dash/dodge move that consumes some of their health. The core gameplay is trying to avoid enemies while maintaining as much health as possible. Throughout their struggle, the player is shown bleak messages of the horror that exists for them. The game can be played <a href="https://cjaxisa.itch.io/dark-days-ahead">here</a>.</p>
