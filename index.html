          <p class="mb-5">Heyo, I'm CJ! I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Game Design &amp; Development in 2021. Currently, I am a Porting Engineer at Whitethorn Games. I really love porting games because it gives me an opportunity to work on a bunch of a different games, meet developers, and above all learn how different games work below the hood. Additionally, it gives me quite a bit of tasks that focus on my favorite part of programming: Optimization. But porting is not my only skill set! I've programmed gameplay, UI, and networking for games in the past. Additionally, I've done design, 2D art, 3D modeling, animation and level design for games. Generally, I love the game development process and getting to learn all about how a game works and gets made is a delight.</p>

              <p>Botany Manor is a puzzle-adventure game all about a retired botanist exploring a stately 19th century home to figure out how to bloom some forgotten flora. I was in charge of porting this title to Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, Windows Store, and Nintendo Switch. This involved working directly with the developer to rework certain mechanics and gameplay sections to fit better on console, addressing visual concerns, and assisting in the optimization of the game. I also worked with platform partners and internal marketing team to get featured placement of Botany Manor in the Xbox Store.</p>

There was 1 writer, 1 designer, 1 artist, sound designer and 2 engineers (including myself). The jam's theme was 'Communication' so we interpreted that as a way the player communicates with the game itself, complimented by a story about a character desperate to communicate with others and make new friends.

              <p>Punchdown is a VR parkour game in which the player punches the ground and walls to launch themselves and traverse through levels. For this project I work as a programmer, a level designer, and a 3D modeler. This game started as a game jam entry for the 2018's Global Game Jam. From there, myself and two other RIT students decided to continue development on our project and with the guidance of our professor, Elouise Oyzon. She guided us to help complete the project, linking our group up with a 4th member of the team, our composer and sound designer while also helping us to make the game more accessible. When we released the project to the public, our team was recognized for our efforts by our college, receiving the Excellence in Innovation award. "We felt that PunchDown best exemplified the spirit of the innovation category — games that go a bit off the edge of the conceptual map and then build an experience around it.” - Ian Schreiber, Assistant Professor at RIT and co-founder of the Global Game Jam. </p>

              <p>This game was developed over the course of 6 weeks as a project for a Game Design &amp; Development II class. Dark Days Ahead is what we described as a bullet-hell horror game drenched with existential terror. The player plays as a ball of light attempting to survive in a world of darkness. The world is procedurally generated. The player has a dash/dodge move that consumes some of their health. The core gameplay is trying to avoid enemies while maintaining as much health as possible. Throughout their struggle, the player is shown bleak messages of the horror that exists for them. </p>

          <p>I am CJ, Hi! I like doing game jams (I've even organized a few myself!). Aside from my love for video games, I have a passion for film! Nothing tops the surrealist work of director's like David Lynch and Don Hertzfeldt in my mind. Funny enough, I think when a movie abstracts the human experience, it can be a much more emotional experience. I also love Godzilla movies, specifically from the 1960s. There's a lot of silly special effects and fun choreography that makes those movies a perfect watch on a lazy Sunday. </p>
          <p class="mb-0">When I'm not holed up watching weird movies or playing indie games, I like to spend time in nature! Hiking, swimming, or fishing are all great times in my book. Recently I've been getting into bird-watching. I have this app, Merlin Bird ID, which identifies birds based on their calls and it's so fun!!! I found it's been a really engaging way of exploring my interest in birds! Above all, I find these things relaxing and hugely important to unwind from the stress of game development. </p>
