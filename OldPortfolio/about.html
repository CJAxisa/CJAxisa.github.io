            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>My name is Christian James Axisa, but call me CJ! I'm a Rochester-based game design student currently studying at RIT and looking for co-ops. I love to code and know how to use C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I also love 3D modelling, but my main passion is game design. I believe that accessibility, feeeling, and fun are some of the most important aspects of game design. Some of my favorite games are <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i>,<i>Mother 3</i>, <i>Celeste</i>, &amp; <i>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>. I've been playing games since I was just a young lad. My brother was into a video games and had me playing <i>Pokemon Red</i> before I could read. I remember being so curious to learn about the characters and world. Even though I was too young to fully understand the game's rules, I was still enchanted by the game. I think games have the power to leave people with powerful feelings.</p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p> I think games, like art in general, succeeds when it leaves its audience with an emotional reaction. Most games tend to go for a feeling of delight, exhileration, or satisfaction. I think these can be incredibly successful but work even better when heightened with moments of other emotion. The stress of a tough platforming challenge in <i>Super Mario World</i> helps heighten the simple joy of the easier sections of levels. Games can deliver a wide variety of emotions and I think when games succeed at this, it leaves a huge impact on the player. <i>Celeste</i> succeeds in this by building the game's systems, presentation, and themes around player growth. Levels may seem insurmountable at first having player's feel hopeless. As they keep trying and failing they may dip into frustration at there inability. If the player remains determined and vigilant they will succeed eventually and feel incredibly satisfied. This emotional journey is the core loop of Celeste. As the player's skill grows and grows, they see Madeline grow emotionally within the context of the story. This was such a powerful experience for me that I think highlights how games can impact us.</p>
