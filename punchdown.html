            <p><i>Punchdown</i> is VR parkour game in which the player punches the ground and walls to launch themselves and traverse through levels. For this project I work as a programmer, a level designer, and a 3D modeller. This project is ongoing and is still a work a in progress, but a gameplay video can be seen below. As of Jan. 2019 this project is being worked on for an IGM Production Studio.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>This project started as a prototype for Global Game Jam 2018 made a group of three students, including myself. After the jam ended, we realized we really like the idea we had for the game and decided to continue develpoment. We took the project into a Production Studio and got advice and consultation from our professor, Weez Oyzon. We also picked up an artist and a musician to help us with the project. A lot of our development time was spent research ways to mitigate simulation sickenss in VR. We spent a lot of time adjusting the physics of the game to strike a fine balance between "This is fun and exciting" and "This makes me want to throw up." We released the game on 2/28/20 and have been very happy with how the release has been going. We've found ourselves within the top 40 VR games on itch io! We're thinking of porting the game to steam later this summer.</p>

            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>On this project, me and the three other core developers on the team wore a lot of hats throughout production. We were all sort of generalists throughout the development, distributing tasks based on who we thought could complete them best. Because of this, I did a lot of level design and programming for the project, but also did some 3D modelling, environmental art, and UI/UX. I was also in charge of the social media for this project, and ran the PunchDown twitter account (Follow us @PunchDownVR)</p>
